# Car AI Game
## Introduction
An AI Car game that uses NEAT algorithm that was created by Kenneth O. Stanley. Neat is an algorthim that uses Neural Networks and it has been used for many games including simple apps to Nintendo games. For this project my group decided on making a car game that would use Neat to beat it. My group consisted of 2 other members of CS4800 at William Paterson University and we worked on this project together through the spring semester of 2020.
## Downloads
To run this program there are a couple of things that you need to download. First, you need the pictures that we used for this project downloaded then you need to download the config.txt file that contains important information needed for the game to run properly.<br /> <br />
Next to download NEAT copy `pip install neat-python` in your console. Or go to https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html<br /><br />
To download pygame copy `pip install pygame`<br /> <br />
## Demo
To run this program change to the directory where all of the files are downloaded and copy `python racingupdated.py` to the console<br /> <br />
Running this program you will see how the game works the game closes once the score passes 20. Sometimes the game beats it in the first generation so to see the next genererations you can change the speed in which the cars move by changing the velocity on line 84 if you want it faster increase it if you want it slower decrease it.
